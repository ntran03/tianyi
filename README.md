<h2 align="center">Comprehensive Guide to Updating The Website</h2>
Good luck to whatever Artistic Director is in charge of updating the website!

## Prerequisites
Before you start updating the website, ensure that you have the following tools installed on your machine:

1. **NPM (Node Package Manager)**: NPM is bundled with Node.js and is used to manage the packages and dependencies required for your project. Install NPM **first**!

> You can find more information or update NPM if needed at the official NPM page: [More Info Here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
>
>  A helpful guide that contains step-by-step instructions: [freecodecamp NVM Install Guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/node-version-manager-nvm-install-guide/)

2. **Node.js**: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment required to run and manage server-side and build processes. Download the latest stable version of Node.js from inputting the following command into terminal after NPM has been installed: 
  
>  `nvm install node`

3. **React**: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Because the project is already built, just cd into your chosen file path after downloading the code. While React is typically installed as a project dependency through NPM, you can learn more and verify installation instructions here, but it is not necessary: 
  
>  [Get Started with React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
> 
> `cd your_filepath\tianyi`

4. **Additional Installations**:
   
> npm install react-slick --save
>
> npm install slick-carousel --save
>
> npm install emailjs-com
